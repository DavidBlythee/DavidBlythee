- 👋 Hi, I’m @DavidBlythee
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding and making a better life for myself by meeting people who know more than I do!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Engineering and I work full-time as a Paratransit Operator!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to learn. Getting further with simple and fun projects is always a plus.
